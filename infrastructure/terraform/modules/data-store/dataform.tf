# This local block is used to declare two local variables: `dataform_available_locations` and `dataform_derived_region`.
# dataform_available_locations: This variable is a list of all the available regions for Google Dataform. It is used to validate the value of the dataform_region variable.
# dataform_derived_region: This variable derives the region to be used for the Dataform repository. It uses the value of the dataform_region variable if it is not empty, 
# otherwise it uses the value of the google_default_region variable.
