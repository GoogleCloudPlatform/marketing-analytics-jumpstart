# This file contains the main configuration for Marketing Analytics Jumpstart solution.
# This is the main entry point for the Terraform configuration.
# The configuration is divided into multiple modules.
# Each module contains the configuration for a specific component of the solution.
# The modules are:
# - feature_store: The feature store module contains the configuration for the feature store.
# - data_store: The data_store module contains the configuration for the marketing data store.
# - pipelines: The pipelines module contains the configuration for the ML pipelines.
# - activation: The activation module contains the configuration for the activation application.
# - monitoring: The monitoring module contains the configuration for the monitoring dashboards in Looker Studio.
# 
# The configuration is unique for each environment. If you to deploy the solution is a multi-environment scenario,
# you can create a separate Terraform configuration for each environment.
# 
# This solution is designed to be deployed in a Google Cloud project.
# The Terraform backend used is Google Cloud Storage. 
# The Terraform provider used is Google Cloud.
# 
# As a Platform Engineer, you have to keep the terraform.tfvars file and the backend. 
# The terraform.tfvars file contains the configuration values for the solution.
# The backend contains the state file.

# Configure the Google Cloud provider region for this solution. 
# You can set the region in the terraform.tfvars file.
# The default region is us-central1.
# You can deploy and migrate the solution across several regions, check the documentation for more information.
