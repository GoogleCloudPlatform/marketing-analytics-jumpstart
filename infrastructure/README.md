# Marketing Analytics Jumpstart Step-by-Step Installation Guide

## Overview

Marketing Analytics Jumpstart consists of several components - marketing data store (MDS), feature store, ML pipelines,
the activation pipeline and dashboards. 

This document describes the permission and data prerequisites for a successful installation and provides you with two routes to install the solution. These are design for advanced uses of the Marketing Analytics Jumpstart solution.

**1) Guided Installation Tuturial of Terraform Modules on Cloud Shell**
   
   This route allows you to install and manage the solution components using our cloud-based Developer workspace. You will have the possibility to tailor the solution components to your needs. Allowing you to use only subcomponents of this solution. For instance, developers wanting to reuse their existing Marketing Data Store will prefer this installation method.
    
**2) Manual Installation of Terraform Modules**
   
   This route allows you to install and manage the solution in any workspace (cloud, local machine, Compute engine instance). This is the prefered method for user who are contributing and extending this solution to implement new features or adapt it to specific business needs. This route must also be taken, in case you need to manage multiple brands installations, multiple tenants installations, multiple regions installations in a comprehensive manner.

Once you have chosen your route, check the permissions and data prerequisites in detail.

**Note:** If none of these routes are ideal for you, run this [installation notebook ðŸ“”](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/GoogleCloudPlatform/marketing-analytics-jumpstart/blob/main/notebooks/quick_installation.ipynb) on Google Colaboratory and leverage Marketing Analytics Jumpstart in under 30 minutes. 

## Permissions Prerequisites

### Permissions to deploy infrastructure and access source data

There are multiple ways to configure Google Cloud authentication for the Terraform installations. Terraform's Google
Provider [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference)
lists all possible options on how the authentication can be done. This installation guide assumes that will be using the
Application Default Credentials. You can change this by, for example, creating a dedicated service account and
setting `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` environment variable before you run Terraform scripts. We will refer to the
identity which is used in the Terraform scripts (your email or the dedicated service account email) the "Terraform
principal" for brevity.

The Terraform principal will need to be granted certain permissions in different projects:

* the Owner role in all projects where the solution is to be installed. Required to install products related to the
  solution.
* the BigQuery [Data Owner role](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/control-access-to-resources-iam#required_roles)
  on the datasets containing the GA4 and Ads data exports. Required to grant data read access to
  a service account which will be created by the Terraform scripts. Follow the
  BigQuery [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/control-access-to-resources-iam#grant_access_to_a_dataset)
  on how to grant this permission on a dataset level.

### Google Analytics 4 Configurations and Permissions

The activation application uses sensitive information from the Google Analytics property, such as Measurement ID and API Secret. These information is stored temporarily on environment variables to be exported manually by the user. 

* A [Measurement ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12270356?hl=en) and [API secret](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9814495?sjid=9902804247343448709-NA) collected from the Google Analytics UI. In this [article](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9814495?sjid=9902804247343448709-NA) you will find instructions on how to generate the API secret.
* Editor or Administrator role to the Google Analytics 4 account or property. In this [article](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9305587?hl=en#zippy=%2Cgoogle-analytics) you will find instructions on how to setup.

## Data Prerequisites

### Recommended data location

### Marketing Analytics Data Sources

* Set up Google Analytics 4 Export to Bigquery. Please follow the
  set-up [documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9358801?hl=en). Note that the current version of MDS doesn't
  support streaming export tables.

  [![Google Analytics 4 BigQuery Export](https://img.youtube.com/vi/u4QlVsNh2Q4/0.jpg)](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxo955w1NlF8o5_EZmMdQO7UsxcFxnGt3j?si=zf1X4iEq_8IY_fu2)
  
  
* Set up Google Cloud Data Transfer Service to export Google Ads to Bigquery. Follow
  these [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/google-ads-transfer).

  [![Google Analytics 4 BigQuery Export](https://img.youtube.com/vi/svPy0o9r7eI/0.jpg)](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkx9VT3yyM0GPwDXVVKcBMs2i7qbUmtOH74?si=p6MBZJE32x4EX8bT)

Make sure these exports use the same BigQuery location, either regional or multi-regional one. You can export the data
into the same project or different projects - the MDS will be able to get the data from multiple projects.

### Destination Projects

The Terraform scripts which are used to create the infrastructure donâ€™t create Google Cloud projects themselves. These
projects need to be created before the scripts can be run and their ids will be provided to the script via Terraform
variables. It is possible to install the whole solution in a single project if the projected BigQuery data volume is
small (megabytes or low digit gigabytes of additional data per day). For larger installations or when more granular
access control is desired multiple projects can be used:

* MDS data storage project for all the data curated by the solution.
* MDS data processing project for hosting the Dataform scripts and running BigQuery curation jobs.
* ML pipeline features engineering, model training, model inference and activation application.
* Dashboard query processing project. In case of high volume Dashboard usage this project can enable BigQuery BI Engine
  to
  accelerate the query originated from the dashboard.

### Dataform Git Repository

MDS uses [Dataform](https://cloud.google.com/dataform) as the tool to run the data transformation. Dataform uses a
private GitHub or GitLab repository to store SQL transformation scripts. Customers will need to create a repository and
copy the SQL scripts from a companion GitHub repo before running the Terraform scripts.

1. Create a **private** empty repository in your GitHub or GitLab account.
2. On your computer, check out the blank GitHub or GitLab repository. Instructions below assume that the repository
   will be hosted on GitHub.
3. On your computer or in a Cloud Shell, check out the GitHub repository which contains the MDS Dataform scripts.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/googlecloudplatform/marketing-analytics-jumpstart-dataform.git
    ```
4. Push the contents of the source repository to your private repo
    ```
   cd marketing-analytics-jumpstart-dataform
   git remote add copy https://github.com/<your-account>/<repo>.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u copy main
    ```
5. Clean the checkout directory
   ```shell
   cd ..
   rm -rf marketing-analytics-jumpstart-dataform
   ```
6. Generate a [GitHub personal access token](https://cloud.google.com/dataform/docs/connect-repository#connect-https). It will be used by Dataform to access the repository. For details and
   additional guidance regarding token type, security and require permissions
   see [Dataform documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dataform/docs/connect-repository#create-secret). You don't need
   to create a Cloud Secret - it will be done by the Terraform scripts. You will need to provide the Git URL and the
   access token to the Terraform scripts using a Terraform variable.
