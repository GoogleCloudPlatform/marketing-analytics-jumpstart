Follow the typical GitHub guide on how to [fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

**Note**: 
1. To keep track of the new releases, configure git to [sync your fork with this upstream repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#configuring-git-to-sync-your-fork-with-the-upstream-repository).
2. Don't submit a Pull Request to this upstream GitHub repo if you don't want to expose your environment configuration. You're at your own risk at exposing your company data.

### Complete the installation guide

Complete the manual installation guide in a Google Cloud project in which you're developer and/or owner for testing purposes.

### Modify the code and configurations as you prefer

Do all the code changes you wish/need. 
If you're implementing new use cases, add these resources to the existing terraform module components.
Otherwise, in case you're implementing a new component, implement your own terraform module for it.

### Manual Re-Deployment

Change the values in the terraform templates located in the `infrastructure/terraform` folder and deploy the code your google cloud project.

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
