-- This SQL script is designed to prepare data for training a machine learning model in 
-- BigQuery, specifically for a scenario where you need to determine a lookback window 
-- for feature engineering. It calculates a start date (DATE_START), an end date (DATE_END), 
-- and a lookback period (LOOKBACK_DAYS) from an events table, and then passes these values 
-- to a stored procedure.

DECLARE DATE_START DATE DEFAULT NULL;
DECLARE DATE_END DATE DEFAULT NULL;
DECLARE LOOKBACK_DAYS INT64 DEFAULT NULL;

SET DATE_END = (SELECT MAX(event_date) FROM `{{mds_project_id}}.{{mds_dataset}}.event`); 
SET DATE_START = (SELECT DATE_ADD(MIN(event_date), INTERVAL 15 DAY) FROM `{{mds_project_id}}.{{mds_dataset}}.event`); 
SET LOOKBACK_DAYS = {{lookback_days}};

-- If DATE_START > maximum event_date OR DATE_END < minimum event_date, then set DATE_START for the max event_date and set DATE_END for the min event_date
IF DATE_START >= (SELECT MAX(event_date) FROM `{{mds_project_id}}.{{mds_dataset}}.event`) OR DATE_END <= (SELECT MIN(event_date) FROM `{{mds_project_id}}.{{mds_dataset}}.event`) THEN
  SET DATE_START = (SELECT MIN(event_date) FROM `{{mds_project_id}}.{{mds_dataset}}.event`);
  SET DATE_END = (SELECT MAX(event_date) FROM `{{mds_project_id}}.{{mds_dataset}}.event`);
END IF;

-- This line calls a stored procedure, passing the calculated DATE_START, DATE_END, and LOOKBACK_DAYS as arguments. 
-- This stored procedure handles the actual data preparation for the machine learning model, using the provided dates 
-- and lookback period to construct features.
